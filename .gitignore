`.gitignore` is a special configuration file in Git that is used to specify which files and directories should be ignored and not tracked by version control. It helps keep a repository clean by preventing unnecessary, auto-generated, or system-specific files—such as compiled binaries, log files, IDE settings, and operating system files—from being committed to the repository. By using `.gitignore`, developers ensure that only relevant source code and important project files are shared on GitHub, which improves collaboration, reduces clutter, and avoids accidental commits of unwanted files.
